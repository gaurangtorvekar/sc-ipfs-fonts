# web3 Fonts

### Project website - https://ipfs-fonts.herokuapp.com/

### Description

Google stores popular JavaScript libraries and fonts on their “hosted library” service. Similar to that, I am creating a font delivery service, which is completely decentralized in nature! The fonts themselves will be stored on IPFS + Filecoin, while I am creating an open-source Node app which will help serve those fonts such that they can be embedded in your webpage's CSS.
