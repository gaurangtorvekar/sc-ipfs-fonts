# IPFS Fonts

### Project website - https://ipfs-fonts.herokuapp.com/

### Description

Google stores popular JavaScript libraries and fonts on their “hosted library” service. Similar to that, I am creating a font delivery service, which is completely decentralized in nature! The fonts themselves will be stored on IPFS + Filecoin, while I am creating a completely open-source Node app which will help serve those fonts such that they can be read by CSS.

This project was created for the IPFS ETHGlobal hackathon - https://ethglobal.com/events/hackfs2022/home
